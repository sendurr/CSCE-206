print 'Printing c will print the superlist of a and b: [1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]'
print 'Printing d will print all the values of a with 1 added: [2, 4, 6, 8, 12]'
print 'Printing d[-2:] will print the last two values of d.'
print 'The changes will leave d = [2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 0, 18] and print [0, 18]'

# #Check it
# a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 11]
# b = [13, 17]
# c = a + b
# print c
# b[0] = -1
# d = [e+1 for e in a]
# print d
# d.append(b[0] + 1)
# d.append(b[-1] + 1)
# print d[-2:]
