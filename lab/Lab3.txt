1. play with list and set

L1=[2, 3, 4,10]
L2=[5,3,4,9,10,15]

Print out the numbers that exist in both variables L1 and L2 using set operations

Print out numbers that exists in either L1 or L2, but not both using set operation

Print out numbers that exist in L1 but not in L2. 

merge L1 and L2 and save it into variable L3

Add the following numbers to L2,   103, 20, 34 using  append() function of list. 


2. while loop application

starting with 13, add all the odd numbers from 13 up to 999
save it to variable sum



3. The following code generates 300 random integers
use while loop to print out all the numbers that have factors of 3 and 7
hint: use % operator


import random
x=[int(300*random.random()) for i in xrange(300)]
