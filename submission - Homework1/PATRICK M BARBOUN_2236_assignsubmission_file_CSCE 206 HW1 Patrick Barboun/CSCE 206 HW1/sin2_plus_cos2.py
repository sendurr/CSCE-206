from math import sin, cos, pi       
#The original code did not import the pi symbol, which is necessary in this situation
x = pi/4
#the definition of x was correct in the orginal code
val = sin(x)**2+cos(x)**2
#variables cannot begin with a number so 1_val was changed to val
#the symbol for exponents is ** not ^
print val
#variables are case sensitive so VAL was changed to val
