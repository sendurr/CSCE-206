q = [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f'], ['g', 'h']]
print ("The letter a: ", q[0][0])
print ("The list ['d', 'e', 'f']: ", q[1])
print ("The last element h: ", q[-1][1])
print ("q[-1][-2] has the value of g because the negative means counting from the right side as opposed to the left side as usual so that means g is in the list one over from the right side and two over within that list: ", q[-1][-2])
